# Thalamic-Structural-Connectivity-Based-Parcellation-for-non-invasive-Vim-Identification

This freely available atlas is the result of a structural connectivity-based parcellation of the human thalamus according to its connectivity with cerebral cortical areas (precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, paracentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex) and the dentate nucleus. 

Among connectivity maps, the highest similarity with a histology-based map of the Vim was obtained by the precentral, dentate, and SMA clusters.

The atlas has been obtained from a sample of 210 healthy HCP subjects combining probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution tractography with a threshold-based approach as voxel classification criterion.

A detailed description of the pipeline used to produce the maps is provided in:
